1. Run 01 was 1 run for ancestral admgs sample sizes 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 - for relcadilac, dcd, gfci
2. Run 02 will be for 4 runs for the same as point 1 - so that in total they make 5 runs - can use commit b4a60cfd21c12864070a8a93fb07e6bb39521382 as reference
3. Run 03 will be for ancestral admgs varying the number of nodes [5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50] - for relcadilac, dcd, gfci - can use commit 80a3c11c7c8103f8b00cc6c740584b8 as reference
4. Run 04 is not a separate run, I have just combined the data from point 1 and point 2 to make a 5 run set for ancestral admgs with sample sizes 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 for relcadilac, dcd, gfci
